## Dependencies
* Pillow
* Numpy
* Opencv
* Opencv-contrib-python

I include them on the install file so just run it and will install all the dependencies.

## How I Can train The Model
In The img Foldre make for each person a folder with his/her name then put some of his picture.
after that whene you finish with picture. 
run the trainner.py file that  will creat 2 files trainner.yml and labels.pkl .
don't delete theme because the are the data of the neural network in the tools

## Can I use an other Model
Yeah Sure, Like Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras with it
